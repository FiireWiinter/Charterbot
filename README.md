# Charterbot
Welcome to Charterbot.
Charterbot is a multi-purpose bot, made to use as little bots as possible on a server.
It is currently in rewrite, and closed beta is currently under-way.

## Why Charterbot?
We take our time, to polish features, and to not let them partially done! If we find a bug, even if it's a small one, we are gonna fix it as soon as we possibly can!

## Features of Charterbot
  - Fully customizable verification system (In progress)
  - Moderation commands (Waitlist)
  - Ticket System (Waitlist)
  - Application System (Maybe)
  - Image Manipulation (Maybe)
  - Fun and random commands (Waitlist)
